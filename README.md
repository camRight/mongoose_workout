# mongoose_workout

What does express do? It creates CRUD routes for API and displays HTML pages. Gotta have all the different parts. POST, PUT, FETCH, DELETE. CRUD...

In this app I sought to create the routes to API, and seed the mongoose data after creating a schema and seeding the schema. 

To seed the seed update the package.json script to run: `npm run seed` . I think TODO: Double Check.
